Analytics Engine Team

Goal:
Build deterministic stock analysis functions that operate on the shared dataset.

Your responsibility is to implement clean, reusable functions such as:
- Moving average
- Percent price change
- Rolling volatility
- (Optional) RSI

Requirements:
- Functions must take a dataframe + arguments (ticker, window, etc.)
- No API calls inside these functions
- No printing inside functions
- Pure logic only
- Validate inputs (ticker exists, window > 0)

Deliverable:
A working analytics.py file containing clean, documented functions that return computed values.

You are NOT responsible for:
- LLM routing
- User input handling
- CLI integration
