LLM Routing Team

Goal:
Map natural language user input to structured function calls.

Your responsibility is to:
- Integrate the OpenAI API
- Define tool schemas for analytics functions
- Parse model output into structured JSON
- Validate function name and arguments
- Return a clean mapping result

Example output:
{
  "function": "moving_average",
  "args": {"ticker": "AAPL", "window": 30}
}

Requirements:
- The LLM does NOT compute analytics
- Only return structured function calls
- Add fallback response if routing fails
- Keep routing logic isolated in router.py

Deliverable:
A working router.py that converts user text into valid function + argument mappings.

You are NOT responsible for:
- Computing analytics
- Dataset cleaning
- CLI/demo integration
